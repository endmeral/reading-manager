# reading-manager 
Version: Alpha 1.0

### Description
A C++ program for maintaining a book database.
Add your books to the database or put them on your to-read list.
Things you can add to your book: author, title, date published, description, cover photo (as a link).

Note: this program started as a homework given by my University.
The way the program is made is not dictated by me per-se, but rather the course curriculum, hence using Qt for UI. 
Nevertheless, I hope this program might prove useful to book enthusiats, such as myself. Enjoy!

### Features
Right now, this is what you can use the program for:
* Add books to your database
* Save books you want to read to your reading list
* Command line interface

### Development Plans
As the program progresses, I hope to add the following features:
* Graphical User Interface using Qt
* Functionality for deleting books
* Undo & redo functionality
* Better command line interface
